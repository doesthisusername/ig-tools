## igt
`igt` is an in-progress C re-write of some of the Python scripts.

### Usage
Typical usage would be something like: `./igt <command> <args...>`.

As of writing, the only implemented command is `dec` (analogous to `ig_dec.py`), taking `args...` in the form of `<src_file> <dst_file>`.

### Building
It should hopefully be pretty simple to build; just run `make` here.
